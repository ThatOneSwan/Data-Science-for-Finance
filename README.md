# Data-Science-for-Finance

All of these python files are the implementations of methods described in the paper Long Term Portfolio Management Using Attributie Selection and Combinatorial Fusion Analysis.  They all represent different ways of combining (mainly by using different ways of weighting features) financial metrics of stocks to form predictive models to create optimal portfolios.  The scripts all process financial data from a very large CSV file containing data on stocks from 2006 to 2016.  Some scripts use matplotlib to show the best combination of features based on performance, and some scripts generate a portfolio based on those combinations.  The performance of each portfolio was measured by performing a simulation in a Bloomberg Terminal.
